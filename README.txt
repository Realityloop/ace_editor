------------------------

Description
-----------
Ace is a code editor written in JavaScript, allowing you to edit HTML, PHP and JavaScript
in a very natural way. It provides syntax hilighting, proper indentation, keyboard shortcuts,
find and replace (incuding regular expressions), and more.

This module integrates the Ace editor into Drupal's node/block edit forms, for edititing raw
HTML/PHP/JavaScript in an intuitive way.


Installation
------------
1. Download the latest version of the Ace Editor at https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/downloads
2. Extract and place the contents of the zip file under sites/all/libraries so that ace.js
   is located at sites/all/libraries/ace/src/ace.js
3. Copy the module's directory to your modules directory and activate the module in Drupal.
4. A default text format with the name "HTML Editor" is added to use the editor when editing content,
   additional text formats to use with the editor at 'admin/config/content/ace-editor'.
5. Enjoy this freakishly fresh editor!
